# EE 319K Final Lab: Defender
This was the final project @evargh and I created together. It is a recreation of the popular arcade game "Defender" put into a microcontroller.
The project was very fun, yet challenging and required the both of us to work collaboratively to research, plan, and develop the hardware and software
to build a finished product.
